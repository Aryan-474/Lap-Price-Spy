Project Overview

Lap-Price-Spy uses machine learning algorithms to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications, such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and more. The project involves data collection, pre-processing, model training, and evaluation to provide accurate predictions.


Features

Price Prediction: Predicts the price of a laptop based on its features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of key insights from the data.
Model Comparison: Multiple machine learning models are used and compared for performance.
User Interface: A simple interface for users to input laptop specifications and get price predictions.
Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:


Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lap-Price-Spy.git
cd Lap-Price-Spy
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the notebook (if using Jupyter):

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook laptop-price-predictor.ipynb
Usage
To use the model, input the laptop specifications in the appropriate fields. The model will provide a price prediction based on the given data. You can modify the specifications within the notebook or run the model from a user interface (if applicable).

Example

Run the laptop-price-predictor.ipynb notebook.
Input laptop specifications such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, etc.
Get the predicted price in the output.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features of laptops, including:

Brand

Processor Type
RAM Size
Storage Capacity
GPU Details
Operating System
Screen Size
Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory and loaded correctly into the notebook for training and prediction.


Model

The project uses several machine learning models such as:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
The performance of each model is evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The best-performing model is selected for price prediction.


Results

The model achieves an MAE of X on the test dataset.
Further optimizations and feature engineering are planned to improve the performance.
